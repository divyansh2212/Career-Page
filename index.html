                <h3>Job Description</h3>
                <p>A machine learning engineer (ML engineer) is a person in IT who focuses on researching, building and
                    designing self-running artificial intelligence (AI) systems to automate predictive models. Machine
                    learning engineers design and create the AI algorithms capable of learning and making predictions
                    that define machine learning (ML).
                    An ML engineer typically works as part of a larger data science team and will communicate with data
                    scientists, administrators, data analysts, data engineers and data architects. They may also
                    communicate with people outside of their teams, such as with IT, software development, and sales or
                    web development teams, depending on the organization's size.
                    ML engineers act as a bridge between data scientists who focus on statistical and model-building
                    work and the construction of machine learning and AI systems.
                    The machine learning engineer role needs to assess, analyze and organize large amounts of data,
                    while also executing tests and optimizing machine learning models and algorithms.

                <h3>Required Skills</h3>
                <p><b>To become a machine learning engineer, an individual should have experience with these skills and
                        qualifications:</b><br />
                    • Advanced math and statistics skills, surrounding subjects such as linear algebra, calculus and
                    Bayesian statistics.<br />
                    • Advanced degree in computer science, math, statistics or a related degree.<br />
                    • Master's degree in machine learning, neural networks, deep learning or related fields.<br />
                    • Strong analytical, problem-solving and teamwork skills.<br />
                    • Software engineering skills.<br />
                    • Experience in data science.<br />
                    • Coding and programming languages, including Python, Java, C++, C, R and JavaScript.<br />
                    • Experience in working with ML frameworks.<br />
                    • Experience working with ML libraries and packages.<br />
                    • Understand data structures, data modeling and software architecture.<br />
                    • Knowledge in computer architecture.<br />

                <h3>Salary</h3>
                <p>In 2019, Indeed ranked machine learning engineer as the No. 1 job in the U.S. The same role was
                    ranked within the top three positions in other, similar polls that year. Around that time, Gartner
                    also reported organizations tend to struggle with AI initiatives due to lack of technical skills,
                    process, tooling and lack of know-how in deploying ML models, which also explains the role's demand.
                    As of 2021, Indeed states the average base salary for an ML engineer in the U.S. is $149,801 per
                    year, while Glassdoor states the average salary is lower at $127,326 per year.
